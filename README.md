# 🐢 Blue Chell Mechanic Game

This project is inspired by the Blue Shell mechanic from *New Super Mario Bros.*, where the player character transforms into a shell that moves forward automatically, regardless of the player's direct action.  
The goal is to recreate this mechanic in a new game, offering a fun and unique gameplay experience.
